Understanding voter shifts between elections provides critical insights into political trends, voter behavior, and party performance. By leveraging detailed election results and statistical methods, we can uncover patterns of voter migration that shape electoral outcomes **faster** and **more cost-effectively** than traditional polling. Here, we showcase two compelling examples of voter shifts in Austria and Czechia, showcasing the power of this approach.

## Example 1: Salzburg (Austria) State Elections 2018 → 2023

In the Salzburg State Elections 2023, a detailed analysis of voter shifts helped to answer the main question agter the elections. This analysis, powered by ecological inference, demonstrated how this method is useful when there are no traditional polls available.

### Voter Shift Analysis
Using ecological inference, we calculated how many voters shifted their allegiance from one party in 2018 to another in 2023. This approach allowed us to identify:

- **From whom the succesful parties were getting the votes**: Understand how voters moved between traditional rivals or toward emerging political forces like FPÖ and KPÖ.

Unlike traditional polling, this method provided these insights without requiring direct voter interviews, saving both time and resources.

## Example 2: Czechia – European Parliament Elections 2024

In Czechia, the 2024 European Parliament elections offered a fascinating case study of voter shifts compared to the 2021 Parliamentary Elections. This example illustrates the efficiency and depth of ecological inference in analyzing complex electoral dynamics.

### Voter Migration Insights

Our analysis revealed:

- **Turnout Dynamics**: Identifying new participants or voters who abstained.
- **Cross-Election Movement**: Tracking voter shifts from the 2021 parliamentary elections to the 2024 European elections.

For instance, the analysis showed voters who voted in 2021 but abstained in 2024, as the most important group in the European elections.

## The Power of Ecological Inference

Our methodology relies on the statistical method of ecological inference to estimate voter migration. This approach uses aggregate data to infer individual-level transitions, enabling:

- **Quantifiable Results**: Precise calculations of how many voters moved from one party to another.
- **Actionable Data**: Insights that help political parties, analysts, and journalists understand electoral dynamics.

By eliminating the need for extensive polling and interviews, **ecological inference offers a faster and more affordable alternative for understanding voter behavior**.

## Conclusion

Analyzing voter shifts between elections provides a deeper understanding of the changing political landscape. By combining detailed election results with advanced statistical methods, we **uncover the hidden stories behind the numbers**—stories that inform strategy, reporting, and public discourse. Ecological inference represents a transformative approach, delivering actionable insights with unprecedented **speed and cost-efficiency**.
