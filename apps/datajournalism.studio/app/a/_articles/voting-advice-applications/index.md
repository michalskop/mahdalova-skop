A **voting advice application (VAA)** is a web-based tool designed to help voters make informed decisions by offering personalized recommendations based on their responses to a series of questions.

Using a VAA is quick, straightforward, and even fun! In just 10 minutes, voters can gain valuable insights before heading to the polls, enhancing their understanding of the political landscape.

## Why VAAs Matter

Voting advice applications are one of the most effective pre-election tools for increasing informed political participation, especially among demographics less interested in politics, such as younger voters. 

### Evidence-Based Benefits
Academic research highlights the positive impact of VAAs:
- **Increased voter turnout**: People who use a VAA are **1.25 to 2 times more likely to vote** compared to those who do not. ([Source](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-political-science-review/article/candidates-voters-and-voting-advice-applications/))
- **More informed voting choices**: VAA users are **20-35% more likely to switch parties** if their results show a poor match with their initially preferred party. ([Source](https://osf.io/utdn4/download))

By using a VAA, voters can quickly identify which candidate or party aligns best with their values, fostering more informed and meaningful participation in the democratic process.

### Step 1: Answer the Questions

### Step 2: Get Personalized Advice
The VAA generates a tailored recommendation, showing how closely the voter’s preferences align with candidates or political parties.
