## Why We Do It

The media landscape in the Czech Republic faces challenges with a lack of in-depth and contextual data analysis. Many issues are presented superficially, without strong connections to facts or global context. We strive to change this. Our mission is to enrich public debate with high-quality data-driven insights that can inform decision-making at every level of society.

We leverage cutting-edge technologies and data analysis techniques. By blending traditional journalism with innovative approaches such as machine learning, geospatial analysis, and interactive applications, we bring fresh perspectives to complex issues. Our data comes from public databases as well as collaborations with experts, academics, and local communities.
