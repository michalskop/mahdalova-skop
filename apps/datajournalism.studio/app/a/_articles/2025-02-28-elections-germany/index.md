## Overall Election Results
Overall, the Christian Democratic CDU/CSU won the election. The nationalist AfD came in second. The Social Democratic SPD came third, followed by the Greens, and Die Linke was the last to enter parliament. The Alliance of Sahra Wagenknecht and FDP finished just below 5%. The Danish minority party SSW also has one MP, which does not need to obtain 5% of the votes to enter the Bundestag.

Today, it is expected that the government will be formed by the traditional parties CDU/CSU and SPD.

<span style="background-color: #00a2de; color: white;">AfD</span> â€“ protest right-wing populist party, pro-Putin, sharply critical of migration and the EU

<span style="background-color: #e3000f; color: white;">SPD</span> â€“ Social Democrats, historically strong left, today rather moderate center-left grouping

<span style="background-color: #be3075; color: white;">Die Linke</span> â€“ democratic left, partial successor to East Germany's PDS, today advocates for social justice

Outside parliament:

<span style="background-color: #792351; color: white;">Alliance of Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW)</span> â€“ new left-wing populist party, defines itself against the EU, globalization, migration and neoliberal economics or Green politics
