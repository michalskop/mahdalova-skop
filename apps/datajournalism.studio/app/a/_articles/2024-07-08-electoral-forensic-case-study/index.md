# Case Study: Electoral Forensics in European Parliament Elections

## Introduction

The European Parliament elections 2024 have concluded, but one unresolved issue has taken on the feel of a detective story. Michaela Šojdrová, an experienced politician and former MEP from the Czech KDU-ČSL party, is just **616 votes short** of returning to Brussels. It's possible that these missing votes are real and could be recovered.

## Where Did the Votes Go?

Imagine voting for your preferred candidate only to find out later that your vote has disappeared. This is precisely what some voters in the Zlín region claim happened. These voters insist they cast preferential votes for Šojdrová, yet the official results show zero votes for her in their precincts.

An electoral analysis by **Data Journalism Studio** supports their claims. While Šojdrová has highlighted discrepancies in three municipalities, our broader analysis uncovered issues in six precincts across Moravia. Official results show her receiving no votes in these precincts, while her colleague Filip Benda, a candidate from Prague representing ODS, performed surprisingly well. 

### Key Findings

Our investigation identified **139 votes** that were very likely intended for Šojdrová but were mistakenly attributed to another candidate.

#### Precincts with Likely Misattributed Votes for Michaela Šojdrová

| Precinct                            | Number of Votes |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Horní Lideč                         | 34              |
| Uherský Brod, Precinct 14 (Újezdec) | 34              |
| Lhota (Zlín District)               | 28              |
| Rozseč nad Kunštátem                | 19              |
| Bílovice nad Svitavou, Precinct 2   | 16              |
| Kudlovice                           | 8               |

## A Chance for a Comeback

Although 139 votes may seem insignificant, in the context of European elections, every vote counts. Šojdrová is a well-known politician, and it is plausible that she gained additional preferential votes outside her traditional voter base where similar errors may have occurred.

Recovering **477 additional "lost" votes** could dramatically change her position. This would enable her to exceed the **5% threshold** of preferential votes required for the coalition Spolu under Czech electoral law. If successful, she would leap from the ninth spot on the candidate list directly into the European Parliament.

To this end, Šojdrová has filed a petition with the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, which would decide whether a recount is warranted and how it should proceed.

## How Are the Votes Calculated?

The coalition Spolu received **661,250 preferential votes** in the European elections. Five percent of this total is **33,063 votes**. Šojdrová secured **32,447 votes**, leaving her just **616 votes short** of winning a seat. Of these, **139 misplaced votes** have already been identified, leaving a gap of **477 votes** to bridge.

#### Breakdown of Preferential Votes for Šojdrová

| Metric                                   | Count    |
|------------------------------------------|----------|
| Total preferential votes for Spolu       | 661,250  |
| 5% threshold for winning a mandate       | 33,063   |
| Šojdrová's official vote count           | 32,447   |
| Votes needed to secure a mandate         | 616      |
| Identified misplaced votes               | 139      |
| Remaining votes needed                   | 477      |

## Methodology: Identifying Discrepancies

Detecting precincts where Šojdrová may have lost votes due to reporting errors involves several methods. This analysis focuses on **preferential votes for adjacent candidates** on the shared Spolu coalition ticket. 

### Logical Inconsistencies

Discrepancies appear not only in the Zlín region but also elsewhere in the Czech Republic. However, in Zlín's traditional stronghold of KDU-ČSL, the inconsistencies are striking. It is highly unlikely that a Prague-based ODS candidate would outperform Šojdrová in an area where she enjoys long-standing voter support. The idea that Šojdrová received zero votes in such precincts defies logical explanation.
